STemplate (Simple Template Parser) is a command-line utility written in Go that allows you to parse and render templates using environment variables, files, or strings as input. It's designed to simplify template-based installation scripts, like the one used for installing efitools.

From what I can gather, STemplate is primarily used in the efi-tools repository to automate the installation process of various tools and frameworks required by efi (an embedded file system). The STemplate script is used to generate configuration files, scripts, or other templates based on environment variables, files, or strings. This enables a more streamlined and customizable installation process.

Here's how it works:


STemplate configuration: You provide a template (a Go template) that defines the structure of the output file(s). The template can include placeholders for variables, which will be replaced during the rendering process.

Environment variable injection: STemplate reads environment variables set by the user or existing in the system and injects them into the template as placeholders.

File input: You can specify a file that contains additional data structures (e.g., YAML, JSON) to use as input for the template rendering process.

String input: Alternatively, you can provide a string that serves as input for the template rendering process.


When you run STemplate, it will render the template using the provided input and output the resulting configuration file(s). This automates the creation of customized installation scripts, making it easier to manage complex installation processes.

In the context of efi-tools, STemplate is used to generate configuration files, scripts, or other templates required for the installation process. By leveraging environment variables, files, or strings as input, you can customize the installation process to suit your specific needs.

If you're interested in exploring more about STemplate and its usage in the efi-tools repository, I recommend checking out the STemplate README and the efi-tools README. Both repositories contain valuable information on how to use STemplate for automating installation scripts.
